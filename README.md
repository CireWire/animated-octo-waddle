# Diabetes Data Analysis and Clustering

This repository contains an analysis of a diabetes dataset using Jupyter Notebook. The analysis includes data cleaning, visualization, and clustering using K-Means algorithm.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis contains information about diabetes-related health metrics for several individuals. The features include pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin levels, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, age, and the outcome (diabetic or non-diabetic).

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for the analysis.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebook files for data analysis and clustering. Results and visualizations are included.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CireWire/animated-octo-waddle.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd animated-octo-waddle
```
3. Install the required libraries (if not already installed):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Open the Jupyter Notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to explore the analysis steps.

## Results

- The data cleaning process removed missing values and outliers.
- Visualizations were created to analyze feature distributions, correlations, and more.
- K-Means clustering was performed to group individuals based on glucose and BMI.
